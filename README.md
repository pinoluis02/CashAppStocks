# CashAppStocks ðŸ“ˆ

A lightweight iOS app that displays a portfolio of stocks using clean architecture principles, modern UIKit + SwiftUI patterns, and Combine.

## ðŸ§  Thought Process & Architectural Approach

The core goal was to balance simplicity with clarity, showcasing a real-world, scalable UIKit app enhanced with SwiftUI where appropriate.

### Architecture

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**:
  - Separates concerns cleanly between UI (ViewController), business logic (ViewModel), and data (Model).
  - Improves testability (ViewModels and Services are unit-tested).
  
- **Modular Design**:
  - Features like Networking, ViewModels, Views, and Helpers are organized in dedicated folders.
  - Makes navigation and future scaling easier.

- **Dependency Injection via Factory**:
  - The `StockServiceFactory` centralizes configuration (e.g., endpoint switching), enabling flexibility and easier testing.

- **Combine**:
  - Used for reactive binding (e.g., `@Published searchQuery`) with `debounce` to reduce unnecessary filtering.
  - Keeps the UI updated in sync with the model layer changes.
  - Ensures the UI stays in sync with model layer changes through `@Published state`, which represents loading, loaded, empty, or error states.

- **SwiftUI Interoperability**:
  - SwiftUI was leveraged in the `EmptyStateView`, `LoadingView`, `ErrorView` to demonstrate composability and modern UI practices within a UIKit-first app.
  - Demonstrates comfort with both technologies.

### Tradeoffs & Decisions

| Tradeoff | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **UIKit-first over SwiftUI-only** | UIKit offers more control and aligns with many existing production codebases. SwiftUI is used selectively where it shines. |
| **No third-party libraries** | Prioritized native APIs for simplicity, transparency, and portability. |
| **StockListViewModel `loadStocks()` marked as @MainActor | Ensures UI state updates (like setting .loading or .error) happen safely on the main thread. This allows other parts of the ViewModel to remain thread-neutral, offering more flexibility in the future. |
| **Basic local caching** | Not implemented; assumed live call for simplicity. But caching could be added via URLCache or CoreData layer. |
| **Dynamic Environment Switching in Settings** | Adds value and test flexibility, but could be seen as beyond scopeâ€”happy to remove or feature-flag. |

## ðŸ›  How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open `CashAppStocks.xcodeproj` in Xcode 15+.
3. Run the app on any simulator or real device.

The app fetches real-time (static) JSON files from Google Cloud Storage to simulate:
- A full portfolio
- An empty response
- A malformed payload

These are configurable from the Settings screen.

## ðŸ§ª Tests

The project includes unit tests for:
- `StockService`: including success, empty, and malformed payloads
- `StockViewModel`: computed presentation values
- `FormatterHelper`: price and date formatting
- `StockListViewModel`: basic state filtering (in progress)

## ðŸ’¡ Highlights

- Error, Empty, and Loading state handling
- Search with debounce and filtering
- Dynamic theme switching (Light / Dark / System)
- Custom `StockCardView` for consistent presentation
- Mockable, testable architecture

## ðŸ™Œ Final Thoughts

This app is intentionally clean and concise to reflect good production practices without unnecessary complexity. I focused on:
- Solid architecture
- Testability
- Clear UI feedback
- Swift / UIKit proficiency

Thank you for reviewing! Happy to discuss further or walk through any part of the implementation.
